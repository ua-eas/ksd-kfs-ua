KFS 6.0 local build/run configuration setup
--------------------------------------------

1. linux docker install:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install docker.io
	
2. After doc install we need to move docker because it installs in the root by default
   which will end up filling up root. To move docker see instructions at 
   http://alexander.holbreich.org/2014/07/moving-docker-images-different-partition/

3. Modify docker default options in docker in /etc/default/docker. The spotify maven plugin
   expects docker daemon to be running on tcp port 2375 so set that up here. All docker commands
   will then need to be run with the -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 option to connect to the
   docker daemon.
   
   DOCKER_OPTS="-H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375
   export TMPDIR="/<desired-tmp-directory>"
	

4. Create a startup script similar to the following to startup a docker tomcat instance that points to a
   to your local kfs build output folder.
   
	docker -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 run -d --name kfs-docker \
    -v <local-configuration-directory>/configuration:/configuration \
    -v <local-security-directory>:/security \
    -v <local-work-directory>:/transactional:rw \
    -v <local-logs-directory>:/logs:rw \
    -v <kfs-ksd-ua-overlay-project-root>/target/docker/kfs-build/kfs:/var/opt/kuali/tomcat/latest-tomcat/webapps/kfs:rw \
    -p 8080:8080 uaksd/kuali-applications:ksd-uaf-6.0.0-build1 tomcat-start
    
5. The kfs-ksd-ua maven project has 5 profiles:
	
	a. local-init-profile - this profile pulls and extracts the foundation war file to use for the overlay then build kfs
	b. local-profile - this profile assumes that the foundation war has been extracted so it only builds the ua overlay files
	c. release-with-tests-profile - this profile builds the release kfs docker container after running tests
	d. release-profile - this profile builds the release kfs docker container with no tests run
	e. release-with-dochub-push-profile - this profile builds the release kfs docker container with no tests and 
	   pushes the built container to dochub

6. To start docker run the script created in step 4. An example config/security directory layout can be found in the
    zip file <kds-kfs-ua-project-dir>/src/main/resources/configuration-examples/directory-layout-example.zip. This layout
    must be in place and the appropriate -v entries in the startup script passed to docker to successfully run kfs on
    the local docker container.
